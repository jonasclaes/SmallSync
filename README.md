It's a small and simple file sync application.
You can use it to sync locally between folders or over the network to an FTP server.

Basic usage:

This wil bring up the help:
java -jar SmallSync.jar

Local: java -jar SmallSync.jar -type local -src "full-source-path" -dest "full-destination-path"

FTP requires -type to be ftp.

More features are coming soon.
